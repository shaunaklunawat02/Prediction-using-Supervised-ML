Machine Learning and Data Science Project Tasks-

This Repository Consists of some of the Tasks for Machine Learning and Data Science , containing Supervised Machine Learning Techniques to solve A ML Problem in a Systematic Way. Supervised Machine Learning is a method where the models are trained using labeled data, it needs supervision to train the model. This is a simple linear regression task.
